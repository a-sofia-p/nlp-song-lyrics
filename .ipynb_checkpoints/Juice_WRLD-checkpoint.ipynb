flips the rap stereotype of an artist conquering a plethora of women with a Juice WRLD signature – a slow moving track about sorrow and heartbreak.\\n\\nCole Bennett and Lyrical Lemonade… Read More\\xa0[Intro]\\nMhm, they're rotting my brain, love\\nThese hoes are the same\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\nI admit it, another ho got me finished\\nBroke my heart, oh, no, you didn't\\nFuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle\\nHard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow\\nNeed a bartender, put me out my sorrow\\nWake up the next day in the Monte Carlo\\nWith a new woman, tell me she from Colorado\\nAnd she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow\\nWho am I kiddin'?\\nAll this jealousy and agony that I sit in\\nI'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon\\nI just want real love, guess it's been a minute\\nPissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)\\nTell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it\\nFeel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'\\nRan into the devil today and she grinnin'\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nHey, these girls are insane, yeah, uh\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nAll girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love\\nThink I need a change before I go insane, love\\nAll girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love\\nThink I need a change before I go insane, love\\n\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nTen minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes\\nTo break my heart, oh, no, she didn't\\nFuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow\\nFuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow\\nAnd I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind\\nI know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time\\nAll the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?\\nIt's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nAh\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nNow I am insane, demons in my brain, love\\nPeace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love\\nNow I am insane, demons in my brain, love\\nPeace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love\"}\n"
